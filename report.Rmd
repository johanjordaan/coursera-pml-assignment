## Executive Summary

I build a model to predict the exececis type from the avaiable data. The model model has around a 80% accuracy on the training.


## Overview

This report outlines my findings in working with the ... dataset. I started by examining the data and doing some exploarory data analysis.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
